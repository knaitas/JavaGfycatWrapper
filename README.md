# JavaGfycatWrapper
Java GfyCat Wrapper

Hello everyone! This is my first github repository ever!
Decided to do a gfycat wrapper because I did not see one existed!

Usage is simple.

Step 1: Sign up for the developer's key: https://developers.gfycat.com/signup/#/apiform

Step 2: Download my repository, in MainApplication.java insert your client id and client secret

Step 3: Do your needed tasks with the API!

Any questions feel free to message me :)
